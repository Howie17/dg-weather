Project dg-weather is in the pre-alpha stage, with the latest live version accessible at http://dg-weather.heroku.com. This app is designed to provide weekly and hourly weather forecasts for disc golf courses around the world. The pre-alpha version will have a limited number of courses to search, and a limited number of forecasts that can be requested each day (~1,000). dg-weather obtains its weather data through DarkSky's api, http://www.darksky.net.
